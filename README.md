# 🎓 Student Behaviour Observatory

## 📌 Overview
This project explores how social, academic, and behavioral factors impact student performance. Using a dataset of academic records and lifestyle habits, I performed an in-depth analysis to identify patterns between GPA, department, accommodation, alcohol consumption, and parental influence.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze academic performance across departments and genders
- Investigate correlation between accommodation type and student well-being
- Examine the impact of alcohol consumption on GPA
- Identify external factors (e.g., parental approval) influencing academic success

## 📊 Key Insights

- A specific department had a **15% higher average GPA**, indicating a unique performance pattern worth further investigation.
- Students living in certain accommodation types were more likely to miss classes or show signs of reduced well-being.
- Alcohol consumption showed **clear negative correlation with GPA**, especially when combined with less structured housing environments.
- Parental approval played a notable role in reducing high-risk behavior.
